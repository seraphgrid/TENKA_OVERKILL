SG: dude... are you sure?
SG: ...she isn't perfect... but if you know some emacs, i guess it won't be so scary.
SG: this is on the doomier side.
SG: everything is jumbled right now. it's very fuzzy, so i'll explain some things you should do first.

SG: --- THINGS YOU SHOULD DO FIRST --- 

SG: 1. find and replace all instances of /usr/bin/terminator with the terminal you use
    and the syntax necessary to run each command. alternatively, tear it down and do your
    own thing.

SG: 2. change the commands involving the file manager you want to use. thirdly,
    change the start page specified in c.url.default_page and c.url.start_pages, unless you like
    that (currently, very) stupid thing. 

SG: --- BASICS --- 

SG: spacebar opens the :open -t cmd dialog. ctrl-space opens the :open dialog. C-x TAB gives
    you some privacy. a lets you close tabs. C-u lets you do different things tho interact with
    current URL you're facing. As such, C-t gives you control of the tab you're facing. you can
    move tab positions with shift-left/right. the left and right arrows by themselves navigate
    history. C-h c, the only C-h command that has nothing to do with hinting, clears your history. 

SG: h is now the main hinting key, and C-h gives you access to a variety of commands. a very
    wide variety. the C-x commands -- heady. but they are generally for the purpose of utility
    and some of them will make sense to you if you've used emacs. others are just spam. you
    can help me by desiginating them to keys that make more sense and telling me what you did.
    that'd be cool. 

SG: -- SOME QUICK TIPS -- 

SG: oh... C-x C-a updates the adblock. C-x C-g updates the Greasemonkey scripts that tenka can
    understand. C-d c can clear downloads when they clutter your screen. C-d o can open them.
    M-x is :, and M-X lets you use :set.

SG: you can copy a magnet link, then use C-u t to load the link into rtorrent which would of course be running
    inside of the terminal you specify. if the magnet link is hintable, you can use C-h T to do the same thing
    with the hinting function. you can change this command for the torrent client you actually use.

SG: rtorrent is fire tho. 

U1: microsoft edge.

SG: broken website but i have shit to do button. C-m w. you can change it or just obliterate it, honestly. 

U: GOODVIBES?
