TENKA_OVERKILL

...she isn't perfect. but if you know some emacs, i guess it won't be so scary.
this is on the doomier side. everything is jumbled right now. it's very fuzzy
so i'll explain some things you should do first. if you hate any part of this process,
it's likely that i do too, and that im working on it.

1. find and replace all instances of /usr/bin/terminator with the terminal you use
    and the syntax necessary to run each command. alternatively, tear it down and do your
    own thing.

2. change the commands involving the file manager you want to use.

3.  thirdly, change the start page specified in c.url.default_page and c.url.start_pages, unless you like
    that (currently, very) stupid thing. 

the effect altogether is that it feels pretty massive, yes, but also that you have a tool
that is constantly changing shape. much like emacs. in my own, far more delusional words,
it feels like a diary connected to the internet.
