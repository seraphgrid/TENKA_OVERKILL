SG: dude... are you sure?

SG: ...she isn't perfect... but if you know some emacs, i guess it won't be so scary.
SG: this is on the doomier side.

SG: first, find and replace all instances of /usr/bin/terminator with the terminal you use
    and the syntax necessary to run each command. alternatively, tear it down and do your
    own thing.

SG: some commands are repeated and binded to different keys. there is a reason for this.
    one of them is that im thinking about everything right now, looking for a way to
    cook emacs into this. some are intended for one-handed usage or quick access when
    your hands are in awkward positions after typing or you just need to rest at the
    home keys. that's where things get vimmy.
SG: anyways. everything is jumbled right now. it's very fuzzy, so i'll explain some things.

U: OK. FINALLY.

SG: spacebar opens the :open -t cmd dialog. ctrl-space opens the :open dialog. C-x TAB gives
    you some privacy. a lets you close tabs. C-u lets you do different things to interact with
    current URL you're facing. As such, C-t gives you control of the tab you're facing. you can
    move tab positions with shift-left/right. the left and right arrows by themselves navigate
    history. 

SG: h is now the main hinting key, and C-h gives you access to a variety of commands. a very
    wide variety. the C-x commands -- heady. but they are generally for the purpose of utility
    and some of them will make sense to you if you've used emacs. others are just spam. you
    can help me by desiginating them to keys that make more sense and telling me what you did.
    that'd be cool. 

U: this is too much

SG: oh... C-x C-a updates the adblock. C-x C-g updates the Greasemonkey scripts that tenka can understand. 

U: RTORRENT?

SG: you can copy a magnet link, then use C-u t to load the link into rtorrent which would of course be running
    inside of the terminal you specify. if the magnet link is hintable, you can use C-h T to do the same thing
    with the hinting function. you can change this command for the torrent client you actually use.

SG: rtorrent is fire tho. 

U: MICROSOFT EDGE.

SG: broken website but i have shit to do button. C-m w. you can change it or just obliterate it, honestly. 

U: GOODVIBES?
