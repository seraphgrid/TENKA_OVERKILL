SG: dude... are you sure?

SG: she isn't perfect... but if you know some emacs, i guess it won't be so scary.

SG: you should also understand qutebrowser's command syntax.
SG: this is on the doomier side.

SG: first, find and replace all instances of /usr/bin/terminator with the terminal you use
    and the syntax necessary to run each command. alternatively, tear it down and do your
    own thing. we all have different goals.

SG: some commands are repeated and binded to different keys. there is a reason for this.
    one of them is that im thinking about everything right now, looking for a way to perfectly
    cook emacs into this. some are intended for one-handed usage or quick access when your hands
    are in awkward positions after typing or you just need to rest at the home keys. that's where
    things get vimmy.

SG: anyways. everything is jumbled right now. it's very fuzzy, so i'll explain some things.
SG: spacebar opens the :open -t cmd dialog. ctrl-space opens the :open dialog. C-x TAB gives
    you some privacy. a lets you close tabs. C-u lets you do different things to interact with
    current URL you're facing. As such, C-t gives you control of the tab you're facing. you can
    move tab positions with shift-left/right. the left and right arrows by themselves navigate
    history.

SG: h is now the main hinting key, and C-h gives you access to a variety of commands. a very wide variety.
SG: the C-x commands. heady. but they are generally for the purpose of utility and some of them will make
    sense to you if you've used emacs. others are just spam. you can help me by desiginating them to keys
    that make more sense and telling me what you did. that'd be cool. probably won't happen for like a year though.
